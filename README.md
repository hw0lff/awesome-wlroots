## Brightness Control

No Wayland-specific requirements, so you can use your xorg solution of choice to control screen brightness, like [brightnessctl](https://github.com/Hummer12007/brightnessctl), [brillo](https://gitlab.com/cameronnemo/brillo), [light](https://github.com/haikarainen/light), or just directly manipulate `/sys/class/backlight`.
